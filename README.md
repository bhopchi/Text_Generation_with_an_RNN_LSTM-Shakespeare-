# Text_Generation_with_an_RNN_LSTM-Shakespeare-
The *Text Generation with an RNN-LSTM (Shakespeare)* project uses an LSTM model to generate text in Shakespeareâ€™s style. By training on his works, the model learns language patterns to predict and produce text sequences resembling his writing. It showcases sequence modeling and LSTM-based language generation in creative contexts.
